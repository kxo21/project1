Overview: This webpage is an in-depth analysis of who I believe are the three best Quarterbacks in the NFL: Deshaun Watson, Patrick Mahomes, and Lamar Jackoson.
Focusing on their collegiate and professional careers, as well as their individual accomplishments.


 Details and Functionalities: The main purpose was to create a webpage that compares three young NFL QB's who have made a name for themselves and seperated themselves from the rest of the league. 
 Each html page will focus on each individual player.

Technologies Used: .html, .css, Boostrap, ,js


Ideas for future improvement:
 - Would like to be more dynamic in my webpage creations providing more UI and a bettr UX overall. 
 - More details about each players and a better comparison of the three. This allows the user to achieve a better understanding if why each player is the best.
 - Better webpage layout and color schemes to make the page more eye catching and user friendly when interacting with the page. Obviously with time and practice I will get there!
