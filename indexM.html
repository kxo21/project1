                        <p> In his final year at Texas Tech, Mahomes decided to give up baseball and focus soley on football as he positions himself for the NFL.

                            In 2018, his first full season as a starting quarterback, Mahomes certainly proved his worth all year long. In this season Mahomes went on to win the NFL MVP award along with the Best NFL Player ESPY Award.
